# Signer Tool

Signer registry is a centralized place where you can store your development keys.

Each signer in registry has an unique user defined name. All everdev commands
that require signing or encryption refer to the signer by name.

You can mark one of the signers as a default.
It can be used in signing commands without providing signer option.

Signer repository management in everdev is accessible through the `signer` tool.

**Note:** If you need to generate an unsigned message, you may use the option `--signer none` in any relevant commands in other controllers. Omitting the signer option altogether always means using the default signer.

**Note:** Keys in the repository are stored unencrypted.

## Add a signer with randomly generated keys

Args:
    name    Signer name
    secret  Secret key or seed phrase

    --help, -h        Show command usage
    --dictionary, -d  Mnemonic dictionary
                      0  TON
                      1  English

```

## Get signer details

This command lists all information (including secret data) for a specified signer.

```bash
everdev signer info signer_name
```

Result:

```bash
$ everdev signer info sign2
{
    "name": "sign2",
    "description": "",
    "keys": {
        "public": "760d69964d038997d891fca0a0407c2ffefb701e7cb2f9ff0a87fbbf1e8098f2",

```

## Delete a signer

This command deletes a previously added signer from signer registry.
