# Release Notes

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.1] - 2021-07-26

### Fixed
- problem with contracts/ folder

## [0.8.0] - 2021-07-26

### New
- `value` option of the `contract` commands can accept values with "t" suffix.
  Such values will be properly converted to nano tokens.
- `run-signer` option of the the `contract` commands allows to sign messages with alternative keys different from `signer` meanwhile address is still calculated from `signer` parameter (or from default `signer`). It should be useful for `run-local` (with `None` value) so that it is not needed to specify address explicitly any more.
- `tondev` commands that produce files (e.g. `sol create`) create output folders if required.
- `tondev signer add` command's `secret` option can accept a path to the keys file.
- `tondev se set` options `image` and `container` allow use existing docker 
  images and containers to register SE instances.
- `tondev se delete` deletes registered SE instance from `tondev` SE registry.
- `--version` or `-v` or `-V` global option prints current tondev version.

### Fixed
- "tondev clang set --compiler" didn't change installed compiler version https://github.com/tonlabs/tondev/issues/42
- `tondev` did not not fill the command args with default values when user ran commands programmatically.  
- `tondev info` stopped if one of the tools failed.

### Improved
- In case of errors with giver `tondev` prints new detailed errors describing 
  that there is a giver problem (not in users contract). 
- Component version table prints "not installed" text if some component is missing. Footnote about on demand installation is added.
- Account balance check is added before deploy.
- All commands that require abi file (e.g. `js wrap`) now accepts any input file name. 
- `tondev se version` now prints version from the latest to the eldest order.
- `tondev sol compile` now hides linker output in case of success.

## [0.7.4] - 2021-06-25

### New

- Column `used` was added to  `signer list` with reference to the giver that uses this signer;
- Column `giver` was added to `network list` with information about giver's contract and signer.
- Printed tables now supports multiline cell values.

### Fixed

- "Error: Signer not found:" in case when the default signer has upper letters in name.
- Giver didn't use default signer. From now the giver uses default signer when User calls the `network giver` command without `--signer` option. 

## [0.7.3] - 2021-06-03

### Fixed
- Incorrect parsing initial data params with options `--data, -d`.

## [0.7.2] - 2021-06-02

## [0.7.1] - 2021-06-01

### Fixed
- GitHub Action

## [0.7.0] - 2021-05-26

### New
- Added new option `--output-dir, -o` for solidity compiler to store `*.abi.json` and `*.tvc` files in a separate directory.
   Example: `tondev sol compile hello.sol -o ~/assets`
- Created standalone portable binaries for windows, macos, linux

## [0.6.0] - 2021-04-28

### New
- `ts4` [TestSuite4](README.md#testsuite4) framework for contract testing is supported: install, manage versions, create test template, run tests.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-04-23

### New
- `clang` controller for [C++ compiler](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Compiler):   
  install, compile with 1 command, manage versions, etc.   
- `signer` controller for signer registry management:   
  generate keys, import keys and mnemonics, specify default signer, etc.   
- `network` controller for network registry management:   
  add networks, configure network giver, specify default network, etc.   
- `contract` controller for contract management:   
- get contract info summary, top up balance, deploy, run, run-local, run-executor   
- `tondev js wrap` generates `code` and `codeHash` fields in addition to `tvc`.   
- `tondev contract info` prints code hash.   
- `tondev info` command prints a summary information from all controllers.   
- short aliases for controllers, commands and options.   
  For example instead of using `tondev network list`    
  you can use `tondev n l` and even shorter `tondev nl`.   

### Fixed

- `tvm_linker` downloads always even if it's up to date.

## [0.4.0] - 2021-03-25

### New
